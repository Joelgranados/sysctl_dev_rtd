sysctl OKRs 2025
================

Objective 1 : Provide contextual info on series and the subsystem in general
============================================================================

Motivation is to increase awareness on what is needed in the subsystem, avoid
misunderstandings and have a way to point to the docs.


**Key Result 1.1:**
-------------------
Track all sysctl patch sets through `sysctl patchwork`_

**Key Result 1.2:**
-------------------
At least once a linux kernel release, update the notes about current development
in `sysctl ReadTheDocs web site`_

**Key Result 1.3:**
-------------------
Release the `sysclt ReadTheDocs web site`_

**Key Result 1.4:**
-------------------
Add the `sysclt ReadTheDocs web site`_ to the MAINTAINERS file

.. _sysctl patchwork: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/sysctl/list/
.. _sysctl ReadTheDocs web site: https://sysctl-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest

Objective 2 : Remove all non-core ctl_tables from ``kernel/sysctl.c``
=====================================================================
:Status: â˜‘ DONE

The motivation is to avoid merge conflicts in kerne/sysctl.c, and to to give
back the power of managing the subsystem specific sysctls to their respective
maintainers. There are currently two arrays that we target in kernel/sysctl.c:
vm_table and kernel_table


**Key Result 2.1:**
-------------------
Participate in moving at least 80% of the ``ctl_tables`` in ``vm_table`` to
their respective subsystems

**Key Result 2.2:**
-------------------
Participate in moving at least 80% of the ``ctl_tables`` in ``kern_table`` to
their respective subsystems

Objective 3 : Const qualify all the ctl_tables in the linux kernel
==================================================================
The motivation is to const qualifying ctl_table structs prevents unintended
modification of proc_handler function pointers by placing them in the .rodata
section.

**Key Result 3.1:**
-------------------
Const qualify the net directory

**Key Result 3.2:**
-------------------
Const qualify the ctl_table structs that are modified before calling the sysctl
register function. This is an initial list (possibly more?):
watchdog_hardlockup_sysctl, iwcm_ctl_table, ucma_ctl_table,
memory_allocation_profiling_sysctls, loadpin_sysctl_table.
